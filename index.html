    <h3 class="questions">What is Paranormal?</h3>
    <p>
      Denoting events or phenomena such as
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychokinesis">telekinesis</a>
      or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clairvoyance">clairvoyance</a>
      that are beyond the scope of normal scientific understanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Paranormal events are phenomena described in popular culture, folk, and
      other non-scientific bodies of knowledge, whose existence within these
      contexts is described to lie beyond normal experience or scientific
      explanation.<br/>
      A paranormal phenomenon is different from hypothetical concepts such as
      dark matter and dark energy. Unlike paranormal phenomena, these hypothetical
      concepts are based on empirical observations and experimental data gained
      through the scientific method.

    <h3 class="questions">What are Ghosts?</h3>
    <p>
      In traditional belief and fiction, a ghost is a manifestation of the
      spirit or soul of a person. Alternative theories expand on that idea and
     include belief in the ghosts of deceased animals. Sometimes the term
     "ghost" is used synonymously with any spirit or demon, however in popular
     usage the term typically refers to a deceased person's spirit.<br />
     The belief in ghosts as souls of the departed is closely tied to the
     concept of animism, an ancient belief which attributed souls to everything
     in nature. As the 19th-century anthropologist George Frazer explained in
     his classic work,The Golden Bough (1890), souls were seen as the creature
     within that animated the body.

   <h3 class="questions">What is Poltergiest?</h3>
   <p>
     In folklore and parapsychology, a Poltergeist (German for "noisy ghost" or
     "noisy spirit") is a type of ghost or other supernatural entity that is
     responsible for physical disturbances, such as loud noises and objects
     being moved or destroyed. They are purportedly capable of pinching, biting,
    hitting, and tripping people. Most accounts of poltergeists describe the
    movement or levitation of objects such as furniture and cutlery, or noises
    such as knocking on doors.<br /><br/>
    They have traditionally been described as troublesome spirits who haunt a
    particular person instead of a specific location. Such alleged poltergeist
    manifestations have been reported in many cultures and countries including
    the United States, Indiaâ€š Japan, Brazil, Australia, and most European
    nations. Early accounts date back to the 1st century.
