  <h2 class="ColorRed">THE ENFIELD POLTERGEIST CASE</h2><br><br>
  <center><img src="enfield.jpg"></center>
  <p>
    Another English ghost — this one in Enfield in North London — made headlines
     in 1977. The strange activity seemed to center around the daughter of Peggy
      Harper, a divorcee in her mid-40s. Again, it started on an August night.
      "Late at night," An Urban Ghost Story relates, "Janet, aged 11 and her
      brother Pete, aged 10, complained that their beds were 'jolting up and
      down and going all funny.' </br></p>
      <center><img src="enfield2.jpg"></center>
      <p>As soon as Mrs. Harper got to the room, the
      movements had stopped — as far as she was concerned her kids
    were making it all up." But things got progressively more bizarre from
    there. Shuffling noises and knocks on the wall were followed by a heavy
    chest of drawers sliding by itself across the floor. Mrs. Harper promptly
    got her children out of the house and sought the assistance of a neighbor.
    <br /> <br />"The neighbors searched the house and garden but found no one.
    Soon they
    also heard the knocks on the walls which continued at spaced out intervals.
    At 11 p.m. they called the police, who heard the knocks,one officer even
    saw a chair inexplicably move across the floor, and later signed a written
    statement to confirm the events."
    <br /> <br />Several people were witness to the events
    that occurred in the following days: Lego bricks and marbles were thrown
    around the house and were often hot to the touch. In September of that year,
     Maurice Grosse of the Society for Psychical Research came to investigate.
     "Grosse claims that he experienced the strange happenings — first a marble
     was thrown at him from an unseen hand, he saw doors open and close by
     themselves, and claimed to feel a sudden breeze that seemed to move up from
      his feet to his head." Grosse was later joined in the investigation by
      writer Guy Lyon Playfair, and together they studied the case for
    two years.
    <br /> <br />"The knocking on walls and floors became an almost nightly
    occurrence, furniture slid across the floor and was thrown down the stairs,
    drawers were wrenched out of dressing tables. Toys and other objects would
    fly across the room, bedclothes would be pulled off, water was found in
    mysterious puddles on the floors, there were outbreaks of fire followed by
    their inexplicable extinguishing." The case became decidedly unnerving when
    the spirits revealed themselves — through Janet. Speaking
    in a deep, gravely voice through Janet, the spirit announced that his name
    was Bill and had died in the house — a fact that has been verified.
    The voices and the phenomenon have been recorded on tape and film, and
    Playfair has written a book about the case called This House is Haunted.
    Despite the documentation, however, much controversy surrounds the case.
    Skeptics claim that the case is nothing more than the work of a very clever
    and mischievous girl — Janet. ed
    <br /> <br />The poltergeist activity always
    stopped when she was watched closely, and when she was taken to a hospital
    for several days to be tested for physical or mental abnormality, the
    phenomena ceased in the house. Some researchers believe that Janet taught
    herself to speak in the strange male voice and that photos of her levitating
     in her bedroom merely caught her jumping off her bed. Was this poltergeist
     case just the result of an attention-seeking 11-year-old?
