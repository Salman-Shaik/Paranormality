  <h2 class="ColorRed">The Perron Family Haunting</h2><br><br>
  <p>
    By now, some of you will be aware of the “true story” behind The Conjuring.
    It’s been well documented following the monumental success of James Wan’s
    film.  However, if you haven’t read up on it, here’s what happened:
    <br /> <br />
Seeking the tranquillity of the country, Roger and Carolyn Perron – along with
their children – decided to move to Harrisville, Rhode Island. in 1970 for a
seemingly perfect life.  To the naked eye, the Old Arnold Estate looked like
the perfect home for family life.  Unbeknownst to the family, it was a property
 burdened by generations of disturbing suicides and murder.

<p>
At firsts, the spirits were harmless – friendly, even.  They would help with the
 chores, play with the children, and make themselves a welcome presence in the
 home.  However, later, they would discover the not-so-nice spirits – the
 upstarts who would bang doors, make furniture levitate, and assault members of
 the family.  Though it hasn’t been disclosed, it’s been suggested that one of
 the spirits even molested one of the children.
<br /> <br />
However, the worst of all the spirits was Bathsheba Sherman – a witch and
Satanist back in the day – who hanged herself on a tree on the property when she
lived there sometime in the 19th century.  She was also an unsociable old wench
and wanted the Perrons out.  One night, Mrs. Perron awoke to find the witch
sitting by her bed, warning her to “Get out.  Get out.  I’ll drive you out
with death and gloom.’’  Needless to say, she wasn’t welcoming them with a
casserole.
<br /> <br />
From then on out, the hauntings worsened until the family were forced to leave.
 Unlike in the film, the Warrens were unable to dispel the vicious spirits,
 forcing the family to vacate their home when finances allowed them to.  The
 following owners also reported the occurrence of paranormal activity.
