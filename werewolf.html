  <h2 class="ColorRed">The Demonic Werewolf in London</h2><br><br>
  <p>
    Finally, something to break the monotony of ghosts and their furniture-
    throwing hissy fits.  This time we have a werewolf – or at least a hybrid of
     demon and werewolf.  This account is based on the story of Bill Ramsey, a
     real werewolf in London.
  </p>
  <p>
    Ramsey first demonstrated demonically possessed lycanthrope behavior at the
    age of nine.  Apparently, he displayed superhuman strength, even managing to
    rip out a post from its concrete dwellings. He would also try to bite at
    his family and relatives before having seizures.  In 1983 – now a grown man
    – he admitted himself to an institution after the cravings for blood
    returned, but when in hospital, he attacked a nurse and barked like a dog.
  </p>
  <p>
    In 1987, while displaying a wolfish demeanor, he attacked a police officer
    with superhuman force.  It took six more officers altogether to restrain the
     beast.  The fiasco led to mass news coverage, and the Warrens were on point
    to wrestle the raging mongrel from his wicked soul.
<br /><br />
   After being flown to Connecticut, the wolf demon was exorcised successfully;
   and Ramsey has been a good dog ever since.
