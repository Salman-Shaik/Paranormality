    Bloody Mary is a folklore legend consisting of a ghost, phantom, or spirit
    conjured to reveal the future. She is said to appear in a mirror when her
    name is called three times. The Bloody Mary apparition may be benign or
    malevolent, depending on historic variations of the legend. The Bloody Mary
    appearances are mostly "witnessed" in group participation play.

    Historically, the ritual encouraged young women to walk up a flight of
    stairs backwards holding a candle and a hand mirror, in a darkened house.
    As they gazed into the mirror, they were supposed to be able to catch a
    view of their future husband's face. There was, however, a chance that
    they would see a skull (or the face of the Grim Reaper) instead, indicating
    that they were destined to die before they would have the chance to marry.
<br />In the ritual of today, Bloody Mary allegedly appears to individuals or
groups who ritualistically invoke her name in an act of catoptromancy. This is
done by repeatedly chanting her name in a mirror placed in a dimly-lit or
candle-lit room. The Bloody Mary apparition allegedly appears as a corpse,
a witch or ghost; can be friendly or evil; and is sometimes "seen" covered in
blood. The lore surrounding the ritual states that participants may endure the
apparition screaming at them, cursing them, strangling them, stealing their
soul, drinking their blood, or scratching their eyes out. The modern legend
of Hanako-san in Japan strongly parallels the Bloody Mary mythology.
