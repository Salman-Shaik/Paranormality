  <h2 class="ColorRed">Annabelle</h2><br><br>
  <p>
    According to the Warrens, the real Annabelle case dates all the way back to
    1970, when a Raggedy Ann doll was purchased from an antique store by a woman
     for her daughter.  <br />Upon arriving home that day, the doll was tossed on a
     bed and not given a second thought – at least not until it started to make
     itself more comfortable by changing positions.  <br />Alarmed, but choosing to
     not let superstitions cloud their logic, they attributed the doll’s
     shifting positions to the bed being nudged.  Their opinion changed when it
     started making itself at home.

    The doll was also a deft hand with the quill, leaving notes around the house
     which contained the messages “Help Me’’ and “Help Lou.’’  Then, one night
     they would return home and find the doll covered in blood.<br/>Thus, an expert
      was called in, who put them into contact with the spirit inhabiting the
      doll.  Her name was Annabelle, a seven-year-old girl who was murdered
      years before and left to rot in a field.  During the séance with the
      expert medium, Annabelle told them she felt comfortable living with them
      and wanted to stay and be loved.<br />Feeling sympathetic, the mother and
      daughter agreed to let the doll stay with them as part of their little
      family.  However, it was telling fibs.  This was no little girl;
      Annabelle was a demon with behavioral problems.

    The Warrens were brought in to investigate, and their results concluded
    that the doll was possessed.  It now resides in their Occult Museum in
    Connecticut, living the dream in a display case for paying customers to
    goggle at.
