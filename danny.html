    THE DANNY POLTERGEIST CASE </h2>
  <p>
    In 1998, Jane Fishman, a reporter for the Savannah Morning News, began a
    series of articles about a possibly haunted antique bed in the home of Al
    Cobb of Savannah, Georgia. Cobb bought the vintage late-1800s bed at an
    auction as a Christmas present for his 14-year-old son, Jason — a purchase
    he later regretted.
  </p><br />
  <p>
    "Three nights later," Fishman reported, "Jason told his parents he felt as
    if someone had planted elbows on his pillow and was watching him and
    breathing cold air down the back of his neck. He felt sick. The next night
    he noticed the photo of his deceased grandparents on his wicker nightstand
    flipped down. So he righted it. The next day, the photo was facing down
     again.
  </p><br />
  <p>
  That got his parents' — and his twin brother, Lee's — attention. Trying to
   make sense of the irrational, Al called out, 'Do we have a Casper here? Tell
    me your name and how old you are.' Then he left some lined composition
    paper and crayons and, with his family, walked out of the room. In 15
    minutes they returned and found written vertically in large block childlike
    letters, 'Danny, 7.'
  </p><br />
  <p>
  With his family out of the house, Al Cobb decided to continue trying to
  communicate with the spirit of Danny. With the same kind of notes, Danny
  indicated that his mother had died in that bed in 1899 and that he wanted
  to stay with the bed. He also made it clear that he didn't want anyone else
  sleeping in it. "The same day they found a note reading, 'No one sleep in bed,
  ' Jason, who had moved out of the room, decided to stretch out and pretend to
   take a nap. That, says Al, was a mistake. 'I doubled back in the room to pick
    up my clothes,' remembers Jason, 'when this terra cotta head that had been
    hanging on the wall came flying through the room, just missing me before it
     smashed on the closet door.'"
  </p><br />
  <p>
  "No one really knows," Fishman writes in her second installment, "who — or
  what — is leaving the copious notes, moving the furniture, opening the kitchen
  drawers, setting the dining room table, flipping over the chairs, lighting
  the candles, arranging the posters to spell out a person's name, Jill, then
  hanging the finished product on a bedroom wall. Jason also spoke of other
  spirits: 'Uncle Sam,' who had come to reclaim his daughter he said was buried
   under the house; 'Gracie,' a young girl whose sculpture sits in Bonaventure
   Cemetery; and 'Jill,' a young woman who left a number of handwritten
   messages, among them one inviting the Cobbs to a party in their living room."
  </p><br />
  <p>
  Parapsychologist Andrew Nichols, head of the Florida Society for
   Parapsychological Research, investigated the case. "What happened at the
   Cobbs," he told Fishman, "more specifically to Jason — would have happened
   without 'Danny,' or the bed. It was the electromagnetic energy of the wall
    — that Jason started sleeping next to when they moved the bed
    there — that charged a psychic ability that the boy already had."
